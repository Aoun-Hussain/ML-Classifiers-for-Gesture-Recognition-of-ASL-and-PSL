# ML-Classifiers-for-Gesture-Recognition-of-ASL-and-PSL
This repository consists of code for ML classifiers used for gesture recognition of ASL and PSL.
The project started in the Engineering Design Course at Habib University to cater the needs of the deaf and dumb in the hospitals and clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. The classification was done through various Machine Learning techniques to produce the best results. The classified gestures were then converted into words and sentences which were easier for the doctors to understand.
